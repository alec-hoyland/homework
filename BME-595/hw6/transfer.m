function [H M P] = transfer(F,nfreqs)%% Name: transfer - v2%% Inputs:%    F - a struct, representing an IIR digital filter%    nfreqs - a scalar representing the number of frequencies to evaluate% Outputs:%    H - a nfreqs-by-1 vector, representing the filter frequency response%    M - a nfreqs-by-1 vector, representing the filter magnitude response%    P - a nfreqs-by-1 vector, representing the filter phase response%% Created by: Adam C. Lammert (2022)% Author: ??? (you)%% Description: Compute the frequency response of a IIR filter at the%              nfreqs frequencies equally spaced between 0 and pi.%              Note: this is a version of Matlab's 'freqz'.%% Determine additional parametersj = sqrt(-1);% Fill a vector of test frequenciesw = linspace(0, pi, nfreqs)';% Create a vectors NUM and DEN that will eventually contain % the numerator and denominator of the transfer function.NUM = zeros(nfreqs,1);DEN = zeros(nfreqs,1);% Compute NUM and DEN by summing the terms of two polynomials in z.% One polynomial relates to prior filter inputs and the b coefficients,% and should have its value stored in NUM. The second polynomial relates % to prior filter outputs and the a coefficients, and should have its % value stored in DEN.% <your code here>% Compute H as the ratio of NUM and DEN% <your code here>% Calculate magnitude (M) and phase (P) outputs% <your code here>% <your code here>return%eof
