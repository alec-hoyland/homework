\section{Jail}

\textit{This wide, square room is unlit. Dust covers the rough stone tiling on the floor.
Close to the northern door, four wooden chairs haphazardly surround a rough-cut table,
on top of which sits a crooked candelabra. In the southeastern corner a workbench
covered with unclean implements of torture, an anvil, and small furnace have been
pushed up against the wall. On the lefthand side, five jail cells with long, straight
iron bars hold the emaciated forms of three hyena-headed humanoids.}

This room is the jail and torture chamber for the castle. It was customary, once
upon a time, for the Blackhorse family to haul prisoners into this dark chamber
for punishment and interrogation. The policy fell out of favor with the youngest
Blackhorse, Maric, and the chamber has thus been left undisturbed for decades.

\paragraph{Encounter (5 xp).} A bonepowder ghoul and three gnoll witherlings
mill about in this room. They are drawn to the maligned aura of the greater shade
and find the negative energy radiating off that creature more nourishing than
feasting on the living humanoids upstairs.

\paragraph{Treasure.} In once of the jail cells, under a clod of dirt, someone
has buried a simple gold ring (10 gp).

\section{Troll Corridor}

Three rot trolls tunneled up from the Underdark recenty, but have not found their
way further into Castle Winterhold yet. If they do not encounter any food in 24 hours,
they will return to the Underdark.

\paragraph{Encounter (3 xp).} Three rot trolls hungry for meat.

\section{Catacombs}

Beyond the iron gate to the north (\textbf{Strength (Athletics) DC 20} to break)
and the wooden door past where the trolls have gathered lies the hewn stone
catacombs. The floor is dirt and the walls are coarsely-chopped rocks. Several natural
pillars break up the wide open space, thick with dust and the smell of stagnation.

Several breaks in the rock lead to smaller chambers.

\section{Purple Worm Tunnel}

\textit{Someone has built a simple but effective bridge over a 6 foot wide hole
deep into the earth. Breaks in the wall ahead lead into another chamber.}

The tunnel was made by a juvenile purple worm that has since grown to adulthood.
It senses creatures crossing the threshold and will investigate (to eat them).

\paragraph{Encounter (5 xp).} Purple worm.

\paragraph{Treasure.} Cutting open the purple worm's stomach and searching the contents
uncovers 3 alexandrite gemstones (each worth 500 gp), and \textit{Halvor's Armor}.

\paragraph{Halvor's Armor} This suit of \textit{+1 copper dragon scale mail} has been
wrought from the cast-off scales of a copper dragon. While wearing this armor,
you gain a +1 bonus to armor class. While attuned to this armor, you have
advantage against the frightful presence and breath weapon of dragons, and resistance
to acid damage.

In addition, you can focus your senses as an action to magically
discern the distance and direction to the most powerful undead creature within 30
miles. The creature automatically knows the distance and direction to you.
Once you use this special ability you must wait until the next dawn to use it again.

Halvor Skullcleaver was a half-orc barbarian devoted to Talos who slew the dragon
Issklarvish and the wizard-tyrant Ochlain the Resurrector. He disappeared during
a siege of Castle Winterhold, when his barbarian hordes pitted their might against
Gogren Blackhorse and his knights.

\section{Greater Shade Lair}

When the greater shade is not tormenting Maric Blackhorse, its essence coalesces
here, in the darkest recesses of the castle.
