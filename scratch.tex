\section{Jail}

\textit{This wide, square room is unlit. Dust covers the rough stone tiling on the floor.
Close to the northern door, four wooden chairs haphazardly surround a rough-cut table,
on top of which sits a crooked candelabra. In the southeastern corner a workbench
covered with unclean implements of torture, an anvil, and small furnace have been
pushed up against the wall. On the lefthand side, five jail cells with long, straight
iron bars hold the emaciated forms of three hyena-headed humanoids.}

This room is the jail and torture chamber for the castle. It was customary, once
upon a time, for the Blackhorse family to haul prisoners into this dark chamber
for punishment and interrogation. The policy fell out of favor with the youngest
Blackhorse, Maric, and the chamber has thus been left undisturbed for decades.

\paragraph{Encounter (5 xp).} A bonepowder ghoul and three gnoll witherlings
mill about in this room. They are drawn to the maligned aura of the greater shade
and find the negative energy radiating off that creature more nourishing than
feasting on the living humanoids upstairs.

\paragraph{Treasure.} In once of the jail cells, under a clod of dirt, someone
has buried a simple gold ring (10 gp).

\section{Troll Corridor}

Three rot trolls tunneled up from the Underdark recenty, but have not found their
way further into Castle Winterhold yet. If they do not encounter any food in 24 hours,
they will return to the Underdark.

\paragraph{Encounter (3 xp).} Three rot trolls hungry for meat.

\section{Catacombs}

Beyond the iron gate to the north (\textbf{Strength (Athletics) DC 20} to break)
and the wooden door past where the trolls have gathered lies the hewn stone
catacombs. The floor is dirt and the walls are coarsely-chopped rocks. Several natural
pillars break up the wide open space, thick with dust and the smell of stagnation.

Several breaks in the rock lead to smaller chambers.

\section{Purple Worm Tunnel}

\textit{Someone has built a simple but effective bridge over a 6 foot wide hole
deep into the earth. Breaks in the wall ahead lead into another chamber.}

The tunnel was made by a juvenile purple worm that has since grown to adulthood.
It senses creatures crossing the threshold and will investigate (to eat them).

\paragraph{Encounter (5 xp).} Purple worm.

\paragraph{Treasure.} Cutting open the purple worm's stomach and searching the contents
uncovers 3 alexandrite gemstones (each worth 500 gp), and \textit{Halvor's Armor}.

\paragraph{Halvor's Armor} This suit of \textit{+1 copper dragon scale mail} has been
wrought from the cast-off scales of a copper dragon. While wearing this armor,
you gain a +1 bonus to armor class. While attuned to this armor, you have
advantage against the frightful presence and breath weapon of dragons, and resistance
to acid damage.

In addition, you can focus your senses as an action to magically
discern the distance and direction to the most powerful undead creature within 30
miles. The creature automatically knows the distance and direction to you.
Once you use this special ability you must wait until the next dawn to use it again.

Halvor Skullcleaver was a half-orc barbarian devoted to Talos who slew the dragon
Issklarvish and the wizard-tyrant Ochlain the Resurrector. He disappeared during
a siege of Castle Winterhold, when his barbarian hordes pitted their might against
Gogren Blackhorse and his knights.

\section{Greater Shade Lair}

When the greater shade is not tormenting Maric Blackhorse, its essence coalesces
here, in the darkest recesses of the castle.

\section{The Archwraith's Domain}

When the players enter the Plane of Shadow, whether by the will of the archwraith
or their own power, they will encounter a world subtly similar and yet grievously
different than the one they have been exploring so far. The major landmarks are still
there, but each has been warped, diverging from its path in the material plane.

\section{The Spiderhaunt Woods} \label{loc:spiderhaunt}

  This location is appropriate for characters of 13th or higher level.
\end{quote}

Where the Wending Wood stands tall and foreboding in the material plane, the Spiderhaunt
Wood tangles thick with sticky webbing in the Plane of Shadow. The Wood spans the same
area as in the material plane, but has been almost completely overtaken by giant,
intelligent spiders.

The Spider King, a venerable two-headed spider, is the undisputed ruler of the Spiderhaunt.
It does not care for the archwraith, nor does it have any love for Maledictas.
The spiders have warred with the elves for millennia, and the grudges between these
peoples are as ingrained as the animosity between giants and dragons.

\section{The Blasted Furrow} \label{loc:blastedfurrow}

\begin{quote}
  This location is appropriate for characters of 15th or higher level.
\end{quote}

In what would be Walder's Glen in the material plane, the lich-in-exile Maledictas,
schemes to retake Castle Shadowhold. He has paid much tribute to the Spider King
in order to claim this small redoubt in the forest and has employed a cadre of spider
mercenaries. While he bears no ill-will against Ochrain the Resurrector, the spider
mercenaries and the shadow elves despise each other.

Maledictas does have one other potential ally in this fight, the shadow dragon
Arkilorn, who lives atop the Pillar of God.


\section{Cragmaw Chasm} \label{loc:cragmawchasm}

\begin{quote}
  This location is appropriate for characters of 13th or higher level.
\end{quote}

In the Plane of Shadow, Cragmaw Keep was never built. There was an elven citadel
built there once, but it crumbled long ago. Three wizards came there and established
a research laboratory, away from the prying eyes of their masters. There, they worked
spells of despicable evil and cruel might, experimenting in transmutation, necromancy,
and conjuration. One of the wizards developed a powerful spell, \textit{Conjure Three Dudes}.

For reasons unknown, the first casting failed, killing and fusing the three wizards
together into a single hateful being. The Three-Men (Thremen) despise each other,
hate themselves, and conspire to bring ruin to all they envy.

\section{Druid's Grove} \label{loc:druidsgrove}

\begin{quote}
  This location is appropriate for characters of 15th or higher level.
\end{quote}

The shadow elves of Clan Eirduagh are lead by the undead druid Ochrain the Resurrector.
They have lived in the catacombs beneath the ancient tree of the druid grove for
millennia. The elves and the spiders fight territorial skirmishes. Recently, the elves
were forced from the Blasted Furrow by the spiders, who have permitted the lich Maledictas
to move into that territory.

\section{The Pillar of God} \label{loc:pillarofgod}

\begin{quote}
  This location is appropriate for characters of 18th level or higher.
\end{quote}

An adult shadow dragon live atop the mountain. It doesn't like much of anyone, but
will make a pact with someone willing to help it grow its hoard.

\section{Castle Shadowhold} \label{loc:shadowhold}

\begin{quote}
  This location is appropriate for characters of 18th level or higher.
\end{quote}

When the archwraith coalesced in the Plane of Shadow at the behest of the dark powers,
it displaced Maledictas, who was living and working in Castle Shadowhold. Unfortunately
for the lich, the archwraith possesses much greater power. Its lordship over the
entire domain of dread is such that the lich is but one of many who scheme for power.
